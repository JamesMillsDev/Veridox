# Welcome to Veridox!

**Veridox** is a next-generation *Unit Testing* tool for C++. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to interpret the results. It works using a macro for each unit test allowing for custom reason messages when tests fail. The tool will automatically generate an easy to read *Excel* spreadsheet detailing the results of the testing system.
